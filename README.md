# Neural Computation labs
Python labs - part of the school of computer science's Neural Computation module 

## [Lab 1 - Python Basics I](https://github.com/Taranks7/Neural_Computation_labs/blob/main/lab1.ipynb)
Practise basic concepts in the Python programming language
## [Lab 2 - Linear Regression](https://github.com/Taranks7/Neural_Computation_labs/blob/main/lab2.ipynb)
Implement a simple machine learning learning model for regression. 
## [Lab 3 - Python Basics II](https://github.com/Taranks7/Neural_Computation_labs/blob/main/lab3.ipynb)
Numpy and tensor python programming.
## [Lab 4 - Maximum Likelihood]()
Maximum likelihood - a fundamental method of estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a likelihood function. 
[PDF describing maximum likelihood method.](https://github.com/Taranks7/Neural_Computation_labs/blob/main/Maximum%20likelihood.pdf)
## [Lab 5 - High-dimensional Gradient Descent]()
* how to define a probability density function
* how to fit a Gaussian model using maximum likelihood estimation
* how to define a loss function via log likelihood
* how to produce scatter and line plots using matplotlib
* how to train a Gaussian model using high-dimensional gradient descent/ascent
* how to use pytorch for automated gradient descent/ascent
## [Lab 6 - Automatic differentiation (autograd)]()
- How to create tensors in Pytorch via torch.Tensor
- How backpropgation is performed in Pytorch (via autograd)
- How to split the dataset into training and validation sets
- How to build a model using nn.Module and nn.Linear and train that model
- How to evaluate the trained model using the validation set
